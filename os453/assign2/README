Special Considerations:

Our code compiles fine with the makefile however we ran
into issues with the set_scheduler. We felt that the LWP was most important 
so we spent most of our time on that portion of project. This is shown in our 
code because we passed most of the LWP testcases. We thought thatthe scheduler
was only small part, but it seemed to affect almost half of our test cases.  
Therfore we feel that we should be graded mostly on our LWP.
