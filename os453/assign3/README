Special Considerations:

My code runs well for multiple philosophers and 
the print table is adaptable so that the number of 
philosophers doesn't affect the aesthetics of
the state display. The only thing is that the
specification doesn't specify that we should
use pthread exit when error checking for
lock and unlock mutexes--I simply exit
with exit failure since that is generally
considered to be a graceful exit. The thread code
also has many waitPrint statements in it
which are intended to prevent threads
from changing states when printing occurs, so even 
though  the code gets ugly in places, it is entirely 
functional  and enables the thread to behave 
synchronously when there is a print in progress.
