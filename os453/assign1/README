Special instructions:
Use make to create object and executable files.
The default makes all necessary files and touches files.
Use make clean get rid of junk.

Special considerations:
The code currently misses one error in the given test file since 
realloc occasionally moves memory to the top of the stack
when it should not. However, in terms of functionality my code 
works, so i'm hoping this relatively small error doesn't take
out my grade. I also don't know why make is different
from make intel-all since intel-all already builds everything
in 32 and 64 bit, so make is very similar in essense since
it has to build all library files anyways. i also included the 
try me file since the test suite required it.
