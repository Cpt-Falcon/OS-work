Special instructions:
Use make to create object and executable files.
The default makes all necessary files and touches files.
Use make clean get rid of all code.
Run the bash script I have provided for my own tests.
My bash script does > outfile and > outfileCmp first
so that way the files always show up for the sort
regardless of how the system operates.

Special considerations:
Since I was coding the make file through putty at home,
I occasionally get a clock synchronization warning
from makefile which I think occurs as a result of
going over ssh but it may show up for some reason. The
makefile itself works fine though and generates all the
files as well as cleans them with make clean. I have also
tested this numerous times on 64Bit and 32Bit systems in 
several directories and I have saved the test results
and compared them to just running ls | sort -r > outfile
in regular shell. Finally, the shell command chmod u-w did
not work on my terminal and I used chmod 411 outfile to test
the write permission error.
