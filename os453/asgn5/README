  Assignment 5

Special Consideration:
First of all we completed 109 out of the 122 test cases,
the ones that we could not finish are small diff errrors
of the doubleindirect zones. This happened because we finished the
indirect zones fairly late and there is probably a small bug
which is causing an off by one.

After adding an extra loop to solve the double indirect we are getting 
most of the right output but have slightly different diffs. This difference
shows that we are very close to completing it. We decided to focus on adding 
correct error handling and try and fix more edge test cases. 

We believe that our knowledge of filesystems is very strong and although
we did not pass every test case we demonstrated a thorugh understanding
of the material. Nevertheless we did pass most of the test cases, and many
of them were the small weird error ones which we did not have time to check.

How to runL
To run our program call make all or just make which 
creates executables minls and minget. Use make clean
to clean up the directory.
