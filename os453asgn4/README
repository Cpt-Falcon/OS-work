Run Program: 
To compile our program you need to run cleanup.sh first then 
can add the echo to pass in text to the secret. 

Considerations:
We had a lot of issues writing the report since we learned a lot 
and wanted to be thorough on the writeup. Our driver file compiles 
and runs fine we handled most of the error cases. One of the 
error handling cases we did not know to handle was the reincarnation 
server.We did not know anyway that we could breakour driver such 
that we could test if it maintained that state.
